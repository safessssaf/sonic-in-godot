Recreating Sonic one movement one to one in Godot.
This is my first ever project in Godot, even though 

I have some experience in the raw programming language.

but keep in mind I am still kind of new in Godot, so 

my code might be ugly, but hopefully the nice people 

in GitHub might help me fix it. Thanks in advance.

Devlog #0:
First, I wanted assets, so I found Sonic movement and Green Hill Zone's chunks sprites, so I recreated the ground movement with one-to-one values from Sonic Retro Wiki: https://info.sonicretro.org/SPG:Running. It feels kind of similar but a bit off and slower than usual, maybe because Sonic might be bigger or the maps are smaller? I don't know. Once I figure something out, I will fix it right away. I still have the slop movement, and the air movement I might start working at the three-point world collision box. I also got the animations working. All of this was made in a day and a half; I might make the devlogs on a weekly basis. I know what I did right now is nothing and shouldn't be a full devlog, but I have schoolwork that is taking most of my time, so I can't just ignore it, so the work will become a lot more frequent once I am finished with school, so don't worry about it. :D
